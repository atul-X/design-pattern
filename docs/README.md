## 🎯 **Design Pattern Categories**

Design patterns are categorized into three main types based on their purpose:

### 🎭 **Behavioral Patterns** (Current Implementation)
**Focus:** Communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities
- Define how objects interact and communicate with each other
- Concerned with algorithms and assignment of responsibilities between objects
- Help in defining the communication patterns between objects

### 🏭 **Creational Patterns** (Current Implementation)
**Focus:** Object creation mechanisms
- Deal with object creation in a manner suitable to the situation
- Provide flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case
- Make the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented

### 🏗️ **Structural Patterns** (Future Consideration)
**Focus:** Object composition and relationships
- Deal with object composition to form larger structures
- Describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality
- Help ensure that when one part changes, the entire structure doesn't need to change

---

## 🏭 **Creational Design Patterns Overview**

**Creational patterns** provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

### 🎯 **Core Characteristics of Creational Patterns:**

- **Hiding Creation Logic**: They encapsulate the knowledge of which concrete classes the system uses.
- **Flexibility**: The system becomes more flexible in what gets created, who creates it, and how it gets created.
- **Reusability**: They promote reusing code by defining a way to create objects.

### 🎪 **Types of Creational Patterns Implemented:**

#### **1. Singleton Pattern** 👑

**Location:** `src/creational/singleton/`

**Core Purpose:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **Use Cases:** Logging, driver objects, caching, and thread pools.
- **Implementation:** Involves a private constructor, a static field containing its only instance, and a static factory method for obtaining the instance.

#### **2. Abstract Factory Pattern** 🏗️

**Location:** `src/creational/abstractfactorypattern/`

**Core Purpose:** Provides an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Problem Solved:** Imagine creating UI elements for different operating systems (Windows, macOS). You need to ensure that a `WindowsButton` is always used with a `WindowsScrollBar`. An Abstract Factory (`WindowsFactory`) guarantees that all created components belong to the same family.

- **Key Components:**
  - **AbstractFactory:** Declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects.
  - **ConcreteFactory:** Implements the operations to create concrete product objects.
  - **AbstractProduct:** Declares an interface for a type of product object.
  - **ConcreteProduct:** Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory.

- **Code Example (`solution/Application.java`):**
  ```java
  // Abstract Factory
  interface UiFactory {
      Button createButton();
      Scrollbar createScrollBar();
  }

  // Concrete Factory for Windows
  class WindowUiFactory implements UiFactory {
      public Button createButton() { return new WindowButton(); }
      public Scrollbar createScrollBar() { return new WindowScrollBar(); }
  }

  // Client Code
  public class Application {
      private Button button;
      private Scrollbar scrollBar;

      public Application(UiFactory factory) {
          button = factory.createButton();
          scrollBar = factory.createScrollBar();
      }
      // ...
  }
  ```

#### **3. Factory Method Pattern** 🏭

**Location:** `src/creational/factorymethod/`

**Core Purpose:** Defines an interface for creating a **single object**, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

- **Problem Solved:** Consider a logistics application. The main `Logistics` class plans a delivery but doesn't know if it will be by truck or ship. Subclasses like `RoadLogistics` and `SeaLogistics` decide which specific transport object to create.

- **Key Components:**
  - **Product:** Defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.
  - **ConcreteProduct:** Implements the Product interface.
  - **Creator:** Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product.
  - **ConcreteCreator:** Overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.

- **Code Example (`LogisticsApp.java`):**
  ```java
  // Creator
  abstract class Logistics {
      // The factory method
      public abstract Transport createTransport();

      public void planDelivery() {
          Transport transport = createTransport();
          transport.deliver();
      }
  }

  // Concrete Creator
  class RoadLogistics extends Logistics {
      public Transport createTransport() {
          return new Truck();
      }
  }

  // Client Code
  Logistics logistics = new RoadLogistics();
  logistics.planDelivery(); // Uses a Truck
  ```

#### **4. Builder Pattern** 🔨

**Location:** `src/creational/builder/`

**Core Purpose:** Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so the same construction process can create different representations.

- **Problem Solved:** When creating objects with many optional parameters or complex assembly steps, constructors become unwieldy and error-prone. Builder provides step-by-step construction and readable, flexible configuration.
- **Key Components:** `Product` (e.g., `House`), `Builder` interface (`HouseBuilder`), `ConcreteBuilders` (`EcoHouseBuilder`, `LuxuryHouseBuilder`), `Director` (`ConstructionEngineer`).
- **Demo:** `BuilderDemo.java` builds multiple house variants and shows a fluent builder alternative via `House.Builder`.

```java
// Director orchestrates steps
ConstructionEngineer engineer = new ConstructionEngineer(new LuxuryHouseBuilder());
House house = engineer.constructHouse();
System.out.println(house);

// Fluent builder alternative
House custom = new House.Builder().rooms(4).garage(true).roof("Hip Roof").build();
```

##### Builder – Class Diagram (Mermaid)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class House {
      -foundation : String
      -structure : String
      -rooms : int
      -hasGarage : boolean
      -hasGarden : boolean
      -hasSwimmingPool : boolean
      -roofType : String
      -interiorStyle : String
      +getSummary() String
      <<Product>>
    }

    class HouseBuilder {
      <<interface>>
      +buildFoundation()
      +buildStructure()
      +buildRooms()
      +buildRoof()
      +buildInterior()
      +getHouse() House
    }

    class EcoHouseBuilder {
      <<ConcreteBuilder>>
    }
    class LuxuryHouseBuilder {
      <<ConcreteBuilder>>
    }

    class ConstructionEngineer {
      -houseBuilder : HouseBuilder
      +constructHouse() House
      <<Director>>
    }

    HouseBuilder <|.. EcoHouseBuilder
    HouseBuilder <|.. LuxuryHouseBuilder
    ConstructionEngineer --> HouseBuilder : uses
    EcoHouseBuilder --> House : builds
    LuxuryHouseBuilder --> House : builds
```

#### **5. Prototype Pattern** 🧬

**Location:** `src/creational/prototype/`

**Core Purpose:** Create new objects by cloning existing ones (prototypes), which is useful when object creation is costly or complex.

- **Structure:** Contains both `problem/` (without pattern) and `solutions/` (with `Prototype` interface, `GamePiece`, `GameBoard`, and `GameClientWithPrototype`).
- **Benefit:** Avoids subclass explosion for similar objects; enables fast duplication of configured instances.

##### Prototype – Class Diagram (Mermaid)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Prototype {
      <<interface>>
      +clone() Prototype
    }

    class GamePiece {
      -type : String
      -color : String
      -health : int
      +clone() Prototype
      <<ConcretePrototype>>
    }

    class GameBoard {
      -pieces : List~GamePiece~
      +addPiece(GamePiece)
      +copyPiece(GamePiece) GamePiece
      <<Client/Aggregate>>
    }

    Prototype <|.. GamePiece
    GameBoard o-- GamePiece : contains
    GameBoard ..> Prototype : clones
```

## 🎯 **Behavioral Design Patterns Overview**

Behavioral patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. These patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication by characterizing the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility.

### 🎯 **Core Characteristics of Behavioral Patterns:**

#### **1. Communication Focus** 📡
- **Inter-object Communication:** Define how objects talk to each other
- **Message Passing:** Establish protocols for object interaction
- **Event Handling:** Manage how objects respond to events and state changes
- **Notification Systems:** Implement observer-subscriber relationships

#### **2. Responsibility Distribution** ⚖️
- **Role Assignment:** Clearly define what each object is responsible for
- **Separation of Concerns:** Divide complex behaviors into manageable parts
- **Delegation:** Allow objects to delegate tasks to appropriate handlers
- **Chain of Responsibility:** Pass requests through a chain of potential handlers

#### **3. Algorithm Encapsulation** 🔒
- **Strategy Encapsulation:** Wrap algorithms in interchangeable objects
- **Template Definition:** Define algorithm skeletons with customizable steps
- **Command Encapsulation:** Package requests as objects for flexibility
- **State Management:** Encapsulate state-specific behavior in separate objects

#### **4. Flexibility and Extensibility** 🔄
- **Runtime Behavior Changes:** Modify object behavior during execution
- **Loose Coupling:** Reduce dependencies between communicating objects
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Dynamic Composition:** Compose behaviors at runtime

### 🎪 **Types of Behavioral Patterns Implemented:**

#### **A. Object Behavioral Patterns** 🎯
Use object composition to distribute behavior among objects:

- **🎮 Command Pattern:** Encapsulate requests as objects
- **👁️ Observer Pattern:** Define one-to-many dependencies between objects
- **🎯 Strategy Pattern:** Define family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- **🔍 Iterator Pattern:** Provide sequential access to elements of an aggregate
- **💾 Memento Pattern:** Capture and restore object state without violating encapsulation

#### **B. Class Behavioral Patterns** 📋
Use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes:

- **📋 Template Method Pattern:** Define algorithm skeleton, let subclasses override specific steps

### 🌟 **Benefits of Behavioral Patterns:**

#### **1. Enhanced Communication** 📞
```java
// Before: Tight coupling
class WeatherStation {
    private Display display;
    private MobileApp app;
    
    public void updateTemperature(float temp) {
        display.update(temp);  // Direct coupling
        app.notify(temp);      // Hard to extend
    }
}

// After: Observer Pattern - Loose coupling
class WeatherStation implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void updateTemperature(float temp) {
        notifyObservers(temp);  // Flexible, extensible
    }
}
```

#### **2. Flexible Algorithm Selection** 🎛️
```java
// Before: Rigid algorithm selection
class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(String type, double amount) {
        if (type.equals("credit")) {
            // Credit card logic
        } else if (type.equals("debit")) {
            // Debit card logic
        }
        // Hard to add new payment methods
    }
}

// After: Strategy Pattern - Dynamic algorithm selection
class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentStrategy strategy;
    
    public void setStrategy(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        strategy.processPayment(amount);  // Flexible, extensible
    }
}
```

#### **3. Undo/Redo Capabilities** ↩️
```java
// Command Pattern enables powerful undo/redo systems
class TextEditor {
    private Stack<Command> history = new Stack<>();
    
    public void executeCommand(Command command) {
        command.execute();
        history.push(command);
    }
    
    public void undo() {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = history.pop();
            command.undo();  // Powerful undo capability
        }
    }
}
```

### 🎯 **When to Use Behavioral Patterns:**

#### **✅ Use Behavioral Patterns When:**
- Multiple objects need to communicate efficiently
- You need to change object behavior at runtime
- Algorithms need to be interchangeable
- You want to implement undo/redo functionality
- Complex workflows need to be managed
- Event-driven architectures are required
- You need to iterate over collections uniformly

#### **❌ Avoid Behavioral Patterns When:**
- Simple direct method calls are sufficient
- Object interactions are minimal and unlikely to change
- Performance overhead is critical
- The system is small and unlikely to grow

### 🏭 **Creational Design Patterns Summary**

This project implements multiple **Creational Design Patterns** that focus on object creation mechanisms:

- ✅ Factory Method (`src/creational/factorymethod/`)
- ✅ Abstract Factory (`src/creational/abstractfactorypattern/`)
- ✅ Singleton (`src/creational/singleton/`)
- ✅ Builder (`src/creational/builder/`)
- ✅ Prototype (`src/creational/prototype/`)

#### **🔄 Parallel Structure Design:**

The project maintains parallel organization between Behavioral and Creational patterns:

```
Behavioral Patterns (Current)     →     Creational Patterns (Current)
├── Command (Actions)            →     ├── Factory Method (Object Creation)
├── Observer (Notifications)     →     ├── Builder (Complex Construction)
├── Strategy (Algorithms)        →     ├── Singleton (Instance Control)
├── Iterator (Collection Access) →     ├── Prototype (Object Cloning)
├── Memento (State Management)   →     ├── Abstract Factory (Family Creation)
└── Template Method (Workflows)  →     └── [Additional patterns as needed]
```

#### **🎯 Integration Opportunities:**

These patterns can be combined for powerful designs:
- **Factory + Strategy:** Create strategy objects dynamically
- **Builder + Command:** Build complex command objects
- **Singleton + Observer:** Global event management systems
- **Prototype + Memento:** Efficient state cloning and restoration

---

### 2. Observer Pattern 👁️

**Location:** `src/behavioural/observer/`

**Core Purpose:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified automatically.

#### Key Components:
- **Subject Interface:** Attach, detach, notify observers
- **Observer Interface:** Update method for notifications
- **Concrete Subject:** Maintains state and observer list
- **Concrete Observers:** React to state changes

#### Real-World Use Cases:
- **GUI Applications:** Model-View architectures (MVC, MVP, MVVM)
- **Event Systems:** DOM events, custom event handlers
- **Stock Market:** Price change notifications
- **Social Media:** Notification systems for followers

#### 📈 **Real-World Example 1: Stock Market Trading System**

```java
// Observer Interface
interface StockObserver {
    void update(String stockSymbol, double price, double change);
    String getObserverName();
}

// Subject Interface
interface StockSubject {
    void addObserver(StockObserver observer);
    void removeObserver(StockObserver observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}

// Concrete Subject - Stock
class Stock implements StockSubject {
    private String symbol;
    private double price;
    private double previousPrice;
    private List<StockObserver> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public Stock(String symbol, double initialPrice) {
        this.symbol = symbol;
        this.price = initialPrice;
        this.previousPrice = initialPrice;
    }
    
    public void setPrice(double newPrice) {
        this.previousPrice = this.price;
        this.price = newPrice;
        System.out.println("📊 " + symbol + " price updated: $" + price);
        notifyObservers();
    }
    
    public void addObserver(StockObserver observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
        System.out.println("➕ " + observer.getObserverName() + " subscribed to " + symbol);
    }
    
    public void removeObserver(StockObserver observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
        System.out.println("➖ " + observer.getObserverName() + " unsubscribed from " + symbol);
    }
    
    public void notifyObservers() {
        double change = price - previousPrice;
        for (StockObserver observer : observers) {
            observer.update(symbol, price, change);

            }
        }
    }

#### 🎯 **Key Benefits Demonstrated:**
- **📡 Loose Coupling:** Subjects don't know about specific observer implementations
- **🔄 Dynamic Relationships:** Observers can subscribe/unsubscribe at runtime
- **📢 Broadcast Communication:** One event notifies multiple observers simultaneously
- **⚡ Event-Driven Architecture:** Automatic reactions to state changes
- **🎛️ Flexible Notifications:** Different observers can handle events differently
- **📊 Real-Time Updates:** Immediate propagation of changes to interested parties

---

### 3. Strategy Pattern 🎯

**Location:** `src/behavioural/strategy/`

**Core Purpose:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

#### Key Components:
- **Strategy Interface:** Common interface for all algorithms
- **Concrete Strategies:** Different algorithm implementations
- **Context:** Uses strategy to perform operations

#### Real-World Use Cases:
- **Payment Processing:** Credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency
- **Sorting Algorithms:** QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort
- **Navigation Apps:** Fastest route, shortest route, scenic route
- **Authentication:** OAuth, LDAP, database authentication

---

### 4. Memento Pattern 💾

**Location:** `src/behavioural/memento/`

**Core Purpose:** Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

#### Three Implementations:
- **Text Editor with Undo:** Basic undo/redo functionality
- **Graphic Editor:** Shape manipulation with history
- **Transaction Rollback:** Database-like operations with rollback

#### Real-World Use Cases:
- **Text Editors:** Undo/Redo functionality (MS Word, VS Code)
- **Database Systems:** Transaction rollback, savepoints
- **Game Development:** Save/load game states, checkpoints
- **Version Control:** Git commits, branching

---

### 5. Template Method Pattern 📋

**Location:** `src/behavioural/template/`

**Core Purpose:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, letting subclasses override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

#### Key Components:
- **Abstract Class:** Defines template method and common steps
- **Template Method:** Defines algorithm skeleton
- **Concrete Classes:** Implement specific steps

#### Real-World Use Cases:
- **Data Processing:** File parsing (CSV, JSON, XML, Excel)
- **Web Frameworks:** Request processing pipeline
- **Game Development:** Game loop (input, update, render)
- **Testing Frameworks:** Test execution (setup, execute, teardown)

---

### 6. Iterator Pattern 🔍

**Location:** `src/behavioural/iterator/`

**Core Purpose:** Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

#### Comprehensive Implementation: Notification Management System

This implementation demonstrates the Iterator pattern through a **real-world notification management system** that handles three different types of notifications, each using optimal data structures:

**A. Core Components:**

1. **Notification.java** - Basic notification entity with message content
2. **NotificationCollection.java** - Interface defining `createIterator()` method
3. **NotificationManager.java** - Central coordinator managing all notification types
4. **NotificationApp.java** - Interactive application with user input and demonstration

**B. Three Notification Types with Different Data Structures:**

1. **EmailNotification.java** 
   - Uses `ArrayList<Notification>` for indexed access
   - Implements `EmailNotificationIterator` for sequential traversal
   - Ideal for: Ordered email queues, batch processing

2. **SMSNotification.java**
   - Uses `ArrayDeque<Notification>` (Queue) for FIFO processing
   - Implements `SMSNotificationIterator` for queue-based iteration
   - Ideal for: Real-time SMS delivery, priority messaging

3. **PushNotification.java**
   - Uses `LinkedHashSet<Notification>` for unique, ordered notifications
   - Implements `PushNotificationIterator` for set-based iteration
   - Ideal for: Preventing duplicate push notifications, maintaining order

#### Key Benefits Demonstrated:

- **Uniform Interface:** Same iterator pattern across different data structures (List, Queue, Set)
- **Encapsulation:** Internal data structure completely hidden from NotificationManager
- **Flexibility:** Each notification type uses the most appropriate data structure
- **Polymorphism:** All notification types implement the same NotificationCollection interface
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new notification types without changing existing code
- **Data Structure Independence:** Client code works regardless of underlying collection type

#### Real-World Use Cases:
- **Notification Systems:** Mobile apps, web applications, desktop software
- **Message Queuing:** Email servers, SMS gateways, push notification services
- **Event Processing:** Real-time analytics, logging systems, audit trails
- **Social Media Platforms:** Feed updates, friend requests, activity notifications
- **E-commerce:** Order updates, shipping notifications, promotional messages
- **Enterprise Applications:** System alerts, user notifications, workflow updates
- **IoT Systems:** Device status updates, sensor alerts, system monitoring
- **Gaming Platforms:** Achievement notifications, friend activities, game invites
